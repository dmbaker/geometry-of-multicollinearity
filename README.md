# The Geometry of Multicollinearity

To better understand the effects of multicollinearity on predictive models, the geometry of multicollinearity is developed and illustrated by example.  The relationship between the Pearson correlation coefficient and the correlated bilinear geometric forms in three-dimensional space is shown, and the breakdown of the bilinear forms, near positions of linear dependence, demonstrates the deleterious effect of multicollinearity on separability in predictive models.
